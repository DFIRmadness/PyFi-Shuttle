# PyFi-Shuttle
A Python based Server Client model shell (data shuttle) with Sci-Fi Flare.

This is based on a simple Python Client Server with the intent to add Diffie Helman based encryption and Sci-Fi flare.

This is currently under development. 

This script is incomplete and just a framework for now...  A place holder for ideas.
